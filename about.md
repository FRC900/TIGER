## About our Team

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/team.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

The Zebracorns are a <i>FIRST</i>® Robotics Competition Team that was founded in 2002. The team was started as a partnership between mentors and students at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics with the goal of introducing students to engineering principles through practical application. The team has since opened up membership eligibility to include students from the local community. Durham Public School students, private school students, and home school students are encouraged to join the team. The team now openly recruits students from all over the triangle area and routinely has over 50 student members.


## Our mission
<p>The mission of The Zebracorns, a <i>FIRST</i><sup>®</sup> Robotics Competition team, is to inspire and empower students across North Carolina to be exceptional innovators and leaders. Our students and adult mentors work together to learn and apply real-life multi-disciplinary skills, fundamental engineering techniques, and cutting-edge technologies through a creative design process within a culture of personal and team excellence.</p>


## About the Zebracorn
<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/Logo-Mono.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Our Zebracorn mascot, though a bit fanciful, has a significant meaning. Our team was founded in a boarding school in Durham, The North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, whose mascot is a unicorn; however, our team is made of students from various area schools and home-school students. To represent this diversity, we added stripes to the original unicorn mascot and created the Zebracorn.
