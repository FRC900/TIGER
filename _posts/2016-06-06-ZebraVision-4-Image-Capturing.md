title:  "ZebraVision 4.0 - Image Capturing"
date:   2016-06-06
excerpt: "Zebravision 4.0 is Team 900s vision system for the 2016 season; FIRST Stronghold. Our work was focused around recognizing the vision goals using shape and color based matching, recognizing the boulders using a neural network, and integrating the detection systems into a tracking system using the StereoLabs ZED stereo camera. This paper describes our methods of generating data for the neural networks. We took video of the ball using various lighting conditions and different, single-color backgrounds. We then identified the ball in these videos, took the clearest frames with the ball visible, and applied randomized shifts to the background in order to generate data."
