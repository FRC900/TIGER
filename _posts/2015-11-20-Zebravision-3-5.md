excerpt: "Zebravision 3.5 is Team 900's work done in the postseason of 2015 and preseason of 2016. Our focus has been finding new ways to gather information about our robot's surroundings. We have been working to integrate the StereoLabs ZED, a stereoscopic camera, into the 2015 vision system with the Jetson TK1 using OpenCV. Special thanks to Stereolabs for providing support and assistance as we tested and integrated the ZED into our own work. We could not do this without their support!"
