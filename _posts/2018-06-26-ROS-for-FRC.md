title:  "ZebROS 1.0 - ROS for FRC"
date:   2018-06-26
excerpt: "In 2016, Team 900 wrote a neural network for detecting boulders. Last year, we implemented the Robot Operating System, ROS, into our vision code to facilitate communication between multiple processors. But this year, weâ€™ve gone above and beyond what anyone thought we would be crazy enough to attempt. We transitioned our entire robot code -- including hardware control -- into ROS."
