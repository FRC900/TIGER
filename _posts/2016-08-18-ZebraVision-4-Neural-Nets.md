title:  "ZebraVision 4.0 - Neural Nets"
date:   2016-08-18
excerpt: "Document describing the structure, implementation and utilization of neural networks for tracking game objects on the field in real time. We used the Caffe library from Berkeley Vision, the OpenCV library, and the DIGITS software from NVIDIA to create the neural network. This specific network was developed to track boulders for the FRC 2015-2016 season but can be applied to track virtually any object with proper data collection and training."
