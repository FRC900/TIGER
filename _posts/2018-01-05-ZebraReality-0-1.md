excerpt: "Team 900 has lots of programmers. A positive cornucopia of programmers. Unfortunately, this often leaves us short on the mechanical side of things. Even after we get our robot built, the lack of a convenient practice field makes it difficult to test all of our robotâ€™s functionality or train drivers. In 2017 we decided to program a world where reality isn't an issue. Our first year exploring VR ended relatively successfully. Our driver quickly adapted to a variety of field conditions and his clever maneuvering improved our score in several cases. We went through three iterations of the simulation, primarily rebuilding the robot drivetrains, and finally reached a stable model."
