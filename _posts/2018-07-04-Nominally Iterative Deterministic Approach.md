title:  "N.I.D.E.C. Nominally Iterative Deterministic Approach to Efficient Computation of Swerve Motion Profiles Limited by Wheel Acceleration and Velocity"
date:   2018-07-04
excerpt: "Most swerve profiling algorithms effectively assume that curvature and rotation have a negligible effect. For some paths this assumption can be very problematic, so we have developed an approach for using at wheel acceleration limited (trapezoidal) profiles."
