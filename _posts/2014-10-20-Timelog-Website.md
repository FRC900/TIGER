<p>We got tired of trying to keep track of student hours on paper so we built a program to do so. Students sign in at the beginning of meetings with a barcode scanner and out at the end of the meeting.</p>
<p>
It has adjustable variables for requirements (# hours/#meetings attended) as well as many others (see the documentation for more). We've also set it up to provide graphs and statistics for when schools or sponsors ask.</p>

<p>
There is an example website set up. The credentials are:
<br />
Admin account - admin@900.com / zebracorns <br />
Student account - test@900.com / zebra <br />
</p>
<p>
Feel free to play around and create items, please just don't delete or edit these two users.
Our current setup is a Raspberry Pi hooked up to a monitor and a barcode scanner. It's been working great for us.
