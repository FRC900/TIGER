title:  "ZebraVision 5.0 - ROS for FRC"
date:   2017-09-21
excerpt: "Zebravision 5.0 is a radical departure from previous paradigms of robot software architecture and completes the computer vision team’s take over of team 900 on the whole. The work centered around the implementation of ROS or Robot Operating System into the team’s overall software framework. The main goal was to improve the facility of Jetson to RoboRio communication but ROS represents much more than that. This leap in software interfacing not only allows the two systems to communicate in a dynamic manner, but also lays the foundation for sophisticated control paradigms built upon the open source ROS framework. This distributed computation model will allow advanced work on robot sensor processing, motion planning, environment perception, localization, and mapping."
