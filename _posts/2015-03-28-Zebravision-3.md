title:  "ZebraVision 3.0"
date:   2015-03-28
excerpt: "Zebravision 3.0 represents the culmination of many hours of work and research by the programming students for FRC Team 900, also known as the Zebracorns. It encompasses a library and several applications that are designed to use a Logitech C920 camera mounted to a robot to detect recycling bins in the 2015 FRC game: Recycle Rush. It is designed to run in real time using the OpenCV library onboard a NVIDIA Jetson TK1 DevKit mounted to the robot. The detection is done using the Cascade Classification method and Local Binary Patterns."
