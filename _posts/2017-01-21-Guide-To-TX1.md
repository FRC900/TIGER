title:  "The Incomplete Guide to Using the TX1 for FRC"
date:   2017-01-21
excerpt: "This guide is not complete. It is merely the beginning on your journey with the TX1. It will not answer all of your questions nor is it meant to (It’s “incomplete” for a reason). Before you begin you should start by looking at the available resources you have and read the documentation available for the TX1. It’s entirely possible that this guide will be out of date by the time you read it. It is not definitive and should not be treated as such."
