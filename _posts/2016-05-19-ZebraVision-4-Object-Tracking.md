title:  "ZebraVision 4.0 - Object Tracking"
date:   2016-05-19
excerpt: "Zebravision 4.0 is Team 900s vision system for the 2016 season; FIRST Stronghold. Our work was focused around recognizing the vision goals using shape and color based matching, recognizing the boulders using a neural network, and integrating the detection systems into a tracking system using the StereoLabs ZED stereo camera. This paper describes our tracking system, or how we get useful information that is persistent across frames from our detections."
