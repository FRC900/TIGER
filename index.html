                	<p>TIGER was started by The Zebracorns in 2017 as a 2 year program to help new teams gain access to the resources needed for FRC. 
			Teams apply to the program during the year with a written application and commitments from the hosting school. 
			Teams accepted have ~5 students come to stay on NCSSM's campus for 2 weeks during the summer to learn the basics of strategy, programming, and mechanical. 
			Support is provided through the following year, and the second summer teams come back for one week to learn more advanced techniques. </p>
			<p>This site is a cumulation of resources we use for the course which we hope other teams can use. If you have questions or would like to see other content, please feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:support@team900.org" target="_blank">support@team900.org</a> </p>
